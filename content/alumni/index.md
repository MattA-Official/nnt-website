 ## Stay Connected with the NNT Alumni Network
 
 Keep in touch, build connections, and be part of the NNT Alumni Network during this exciting time in the history of the Nottingham New Theatre.
 
 We produce bi-annual newsletters, alongside our [Facebook](https://facebook.com/thenottinghamnewtheatre/) account. Our network has expanded over the last few years to include over 200 members, with our earliest members graduating back in 1953!
 
 The Alumni Network was founded in 2013 on three principles:
 - To build a stronger sense of the history of the theatre
 - To build connections between current and previous members
 - To keep alumni informed of the progress of both the theatre and fellow alumni.

 ## New Theatre History Project
 
 The New Theatre History Project is an archive of every show, committee, member, and publicity material since the start of student theatre at the University of Nottingham. Our current information suggests that the Nottingham Dramatic Society formed in 1927 â€“ this means that we have a history which spans almost 90 years! But, it's incomplete &ndash; if you have any information to add please [get in touch](mailto:history@newtheatre.org.uk)!
 
 An archive such as this is completely unique among both student and professional theatres in this country. We haven't found a single other theatre which offers such an extensive, vibrant, and interactive online archive.
